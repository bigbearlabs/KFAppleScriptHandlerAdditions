2.3, 12/31/2004

    - Fixed a memory leak. (Thanks to Wade Cosgrove)

2.2, 11/27/2004

    - Fixed a bug that preventing error reporting in old-style methods.  (Reported by Michael Keller)
    
    - Corrected and updated ReadMe.txt

2.1, 7/26/2004

    - Introduced  -[NSAppleScript executeHandler:withParameters:] and related methods.  New execute 
      methods throw exceptions instead of filling out error dictionaries.  Old methods will hang around
      for compatibility.
      
    - Fixed a bug in +[NSNumber kfNumberWithSignedIntP:(void *)int_p byteCount:(int)bytes] and 
      similar. I don't think it was possible to trigger the bug on any existing system.
      
    - Added translation between NSNull and descriptor of type typeNull.
    
    - Changed docs to reflect that -[NSAppleScript executeHandler:withParameters:] and friends can
      use commands defined in scripting additions.  I was wrong before.
